# A Transportation Company Management System
# Learning Outcomes:
 Write a C++ program that utilizes multiple classes
 Appreciate the usefulness of reusing code
 Develop a class based on the use of an array as a means of storing a collection of objects

In this project, I implemented several C++ classes for a transportation company with several
branches in different cities. This project aims to create a storage system for this company. It
will allow the users to generate different types of reports related to the branches and vehicles of
the transportation company. I put each of the class declarations in a separate header file and
implement the member methods in separate .cpp files.

# Heroes of the Board: Legendary two-player board game
# Learning Outcomes:
 Combine previously learned concepts to form a project
 Appreciate clever design and reusability of functionality

In the game, two players (the computer will not play the game) will
have one board each. In each square of the board, the players can place their pieces.
I created a class for the boards. There should be two objects of type board for each player.
created a base abstract class, "Pieces", which will have a life and representing character. There
are two sub-classes which are Ranged and Melee pieces. The Ranged class is further derived
for Bowman, Elf, and Mage whereas Melee class is derived for Spearman, Ranger, Swordsman,
and Knight. You should store the number of times each piece was used for some restrictions.
